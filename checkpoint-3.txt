1) Absolute positioning is independant to the flow of the HTML file and styling. Thus all positioning and coordinates that are set for that specific content 
are relative to its parents position. While relative positioning is dependant of the flow of the HTML document and dependant of its original position in 
the file. Based on that original relative position its coordinates on the document can be set.
2) Box-sizing: border box treats its content differently by ensuring that its original width and height are not changed when the padding width is changed.
This is because originally if the box-sizing default used, and padding is changed, this then adds and changes the size of the overall box.
